# Employee Salary Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on features such as years of experience, education level, and age.

## Files
- `employee_salary_prediction_data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
- `employee_salary_prediction.py`: Python script that trains the model, evaluates it, and saves predictions.
- `employee_salary_predictions.csv`: Output file containing actual and predicted salaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python employee_salary_prediction.py
   ```
3. Check the `employee_salary_predictions.csv` file for results.

## Future Improvements
- Use additional features such as job title or location to improve predictions.
- Experiment with more advanced machine learning models.
